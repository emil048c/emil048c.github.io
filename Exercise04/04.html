                        <p>Palu, Indonesia (CNN)Puteri Pratiwi was riding home with her cousin, Ita, late on Friday night in her hometown of Palu when she felt the ground shudder beneath her.

                            The 18-year-old fell to the ground and was still sitting in shock when she saw the monstrous wave surging up the bay toward her city.
                            "I shouted at my friend, 'Let's run fast! Run!' We ran but she turned back to save the motorbike," Puteri told CNN from her hospital bed outside the Undata Hospital in Palu. She survived the tsunami holding onto a pillar. Three days later, she found out her cousin had been swept away and died.

                        <h2>Bill would block ICE from arresting immigrant child sponsors</h2>
                        <p>
                            Washington (CNN)A bipartisan group of lawmakers are seeking to prevent the Trump administration from arresting undocumented immigrants who come forward to take care of undocumented immigrant children who are in the country alone, after CNN reported such arrests were happening.
                            A bill set to be introduced Tuesday comes as both the number of immigrant children in government custody and the length of time those children are being detained are skyrocketing. The Trump administration's own policies are at least partly responsible for the increase in both numbers and hundreds of children are being sent to a temporary tent facility in Texas set up to accommodate them.

                        <h2>Nobel Prize in Physics is shared by a woman, the first in 55 years</h2>
                        <img src="images/nobel.jpg" alt="A portrait of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor">
                        <p>(CNN)The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Arthur Ashkin, and the other half jointly to Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland "for their groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics."

                            Nobel Laureate Arthur Ashkin has been awarded the Nobel Prize for the optical tweezers and their application to biological systems, while Laureates Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland have been awarded the prize for their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.
                            Strickland is the first woman in 55 years to be awarded the prize.
                            "We need to celebrate women physicists because we're out there. I'm honored to be one of those women," Strickland said in a news conference following the announcement in Stockholm.
                            Speaking about being the third woman to ever win the award, she said: "Hopefully in time it will start to move forward at a faster rate."
                            Ashkin is American, Mourou is French and Strickland is Canadian.
